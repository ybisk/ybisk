### Hi, I'm Yonatan ðŸ‘‹
#### Assistant Professor in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University


My primary research focus is on multimodal language grounding in [Images](https://github.com/rowanz/r2c) or [Actions](https://askforalfred.com/). Previously, I worked on unsupervised learning of syntax via [CGG](https://github.com/ybisk/CCG-Induction)/[HMMs](https://github.com/ketranm/neuralHMM). 

--> What i'm actually up to is over at [TalkingToRobots.com](https://talkingtorobots.com/)
